# Submission Language Plugin for OJS 3.4

Display the manuscript language declared by the author upon creating a new submission for a multi-language journal. This plugin works only on the editorial dashboard for users with Manager-level roles.

Submission language will be displayed next to the title as a country flag or as a two-letter ISO country code in browsers not supporting country flag emoji (e.g., Chromium browsers on Windows).
